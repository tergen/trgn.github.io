I'm a John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellow at the [Center for European Studies at Harvard University](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu) and a senior researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](https://www.mpifg.de). Most of my empirical research is on energy transitions, economic competition, innovation and technology policy, and the history of the postindustrial economy. I also work on theoretical problems, such as the contribution of pragmatist thought to understand political economic change, the question of how to reconcile theories from political economy and economic sociology, and the role of collective expectations in politics. I'm a co-organizer of the [SASE](https://sase.org) Research Network *Digital Economy* and a member of [SASE's Executive Council](https://sase.org/about/leadership/).
